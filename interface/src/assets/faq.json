          "question": "What's DAOplomacy?",
          "answer": "DAOplomacy is a DAO-flavored take on the popular strategic board game \"Diplomacy.\" Essentially it's DAOs fighting (and most importantly, negotiating alliances) on an imaginary geographical map to conquer territories.\n\nWe hope people have fun playing it, and while doing so learn a little about DAOs, to ultimately boost participation in DAOs and governance.\n\nRead more about [DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)](https://decrypt.co/resources/decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao) or about [the game of Diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game))."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the goal of DAOplomacy?",
          "answer": "The main goal is having fun! While doing so, we also want to:\n\n- boost DAO engagement (and voting) and interest in the topic\n- educate people about DAOs\n- test and prototype various governance mechanisms"
        },
        {
          "question": "Who can join the game?",
          "answer": "We want a diverse set of DAOs to be part of the initial cohort, including both new and established DAOs. If you think your DAO should take part, [please read the invitation letter for instructions how to apply](https://daogamedao.substack.com/p/dear-daoplomat)."

        {
          "question": "Is there a prize?",
          "answer": "Yes! The winning DAO(s) will receive a prize, but we won\u2019t tell you what it is yet.\n\nIn addition, all participants will receive DAOgameDAO governance tokens. The distribution will be designed to especially reward the more active players and the winners."

          "question": "What's DAOgameDAO?",
          "answer": "DAOgameDAO aims to coordinate people and resources around multiplayer games that are played by DAOs. Yes, it is also a DAO.\n\nThe first of these games is DAOplomacy."

      "faq": [
        {
          "question": "How does the game work?",
          "answer": "Seven DAOs compete to claim territories on the map. Instead of taking turns, the DAOs secretly plan moves that are all executed simultaneously each round. Since moves are secret until executed, DAOs have to trust each other to collaborate on strategy."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the setting of the game?",
          "answer": "The Land of DAO. It has 75 territories (56 land and 19 water)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you win?",
          "answer": "In order to win the game, a DAO has to conquer 18 or more of the 35 territories with a supply center. Since this is very hard, another way to win is as a coalition: Eliminate some opponents and pass a vote among the rest agreeing on a draw."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's a supply center?",
          "answer": "The number of supply centers a DAO controls determines the number of armies and fleets they can support (one unit per supply center)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does a game last?",
          "answer": "A standard game of Diplomacy usually lasts for about 50 rounds. We're proposing to allocate 3 days between each round, so the game should last approximately **5 months** (give or take)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What unit types are there and how can they move?",
          "answer": "There are armies (represented by a circle) and fleets (represented by a triangle). Armies can move only on land. Fleets can move on water and coasts (land territories adjacent to water). At each turn, units can move to an adjacent territory. The only exception is by convoying, i.e., one or more fleets carrying an army across water."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the different phases?",
          "answer": "Each in-game year starts in **Spring**. First, there is a Movement phase in which the players submit one order for each of their units. Next, there is a Retreat phase in which units that were attacked (and failed to defend their territory) must move to an adjacent territory or disband. If there aren't any units that need to retreat, the Retreat phase is skipped automatically.\n\nThe next season is **Fall**. Again, there is a Movement phase followed by a Retreat phase.\n\nThe year ends in **Winter** with an Adjustment phase. In this phase, DAOs that conquered supply centers during the year are allowed to recruit new units. In turn, DAOs that lost supply centers have to disband some of their units."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the different order types?",
          "answer": "1) Move\n\nThe unit moves to another territory and attacks (if there already is another army/fleet occupying). Move orders are given in the form \"`[unit] - [target]`\", e.g., \"`A EBW - MAL`\". On the map, move orders are represented as an arrow.\n\n2) Hold\n\nThe unit stays in its current territory and defends it if it is attacked. This is the default in case a DAO fails to submit any explicit order. Hold orders are given in the form \"`[unit] H`\", e.g., \"`A RBT H`\". On the map, hold orders are represented by a circle around the unit.\n\n3) Support\n\nThe unit supports another unit, either in defending their territory or in attacking another one. Support hold orders are written as \"`[unit] S [receiver] H`\", e.g., \"`A CSM S A OEB H`\". Support move orders look similar: \"`[unit] S [receiver] - [target]`\", e.g., \"`A BGS S A OHA - RRA`\". Support orders are represented by a dashed line ending in a vertical bar.\n\n4) Convoy\n\nThis order can only be given to fleets and instructs them to carry an army across water. It is written as \"`[unit] C [receiver] - [target]`\", e.g., \"`F ORE C A OUT - AAP`\"."

          "question": "Where does the game live?",
          "answer": "The game will be deployed on Gnosis Chain (https://www.xdaichain.com/). The state of the game as well as an Order Planner tool is available on this website."
        },
        {
          "question": "How are moves kept secret?",
          "answer": "The game will use a threshold encryption scheme and [Shutter Network](https://shutter.network/) to ensure that the moves are kept secret from other DAOs until they are executed."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can DAO members coordinate moves in secret?",
          "answer": "Players should use the Order Planner to generate each move's Calldata. You can use the \"Copy Order Link\" button to share your **unencrypted** order **secretly** with other DAO members. This allows your teammates to review the order and double-check the Calldata. It might make sense for each DAO to create a dedicated private channel for this."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I use the Order Planner to submit my DAO's move?",
          "answer": "No. The Order Planner exists to help you plan your move. You have to submit your move externally, as a proposal to your DAO, by copy-pasting the generated Calldata to wherever your DAO lives."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can my DAO submit a move?",
          "answer": "First, a member of your DAO must make a proposal (by copy-pasting the Calldata from the Order Planner). Then, your DAO must vote to execute this move."
        },
        {
          "question": "How are the moves processed?",
          "answer": "The DAOs submit their encrypted orders to the order collector contract. Once each phase is finished, Shutter will generate the decryption key and send it to the key broadcast contract. Now, everyone can fetch the orders, decrypt them, and execute them off-chain to get the current game state. You can find code that does this [here](https://github.com/DAOgameDAO/daoplomacy/tree/main/server)."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is Shutter?",
          "answer": "Shutter Network is an open-source project that aims to prevent front running on Ethereum by using a threshold cryptography-based distributed key generation (DKG) protocol. Besides combating malicious MEV, it can also be used to encrypt DAO votes (https://blog.shutter.network/announcing-shutter-governance-shielded-voting-for-daos/) and in this case, to encrypt game moves that shouldn't be visible to other players before they're excecuted.\nShutter Network is an open-source project that aims to prevent front running on Ethereum by using a threshold cryptography-based distributed key generation (DKG) protocol.
