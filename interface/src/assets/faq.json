          "answer": "DAOplomacy is a DAO-flavoured take on the popular strategic board game \"Diplomacy\".\n\nEssentially it's DAOs fighting (and most importantly, negotiating alliances) on a geographical map for territories.\n\nWe hope people have fun playing it and while doing so learn a little about DAOs and increase DAO/governance participartion.\n\nMore info on DAOs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization\n\nMore info on Diplomacy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)"

          "question": "Who can join the game?",
          "answer": "We want a diverse set of DAOs, established ones and new ones to be part of the initial cohort. If you think a DAO you're part of should take part, please apply here!"

          "question": "Is there a prize?",
          "answer": "Yes! All partipants receive DAOgameDAO shares according to a specific algorithm (e.g. more active players, winners get more). Winners and winning DAOs receive special winner NFTs"

          "question": "What's the goal of the game?",
          "answer": "The goal is for one DAO to capture all territories on the map via taking them over ideally with support from an allied DAO."

        {
          "question": "What's a supply center?",
          "answer": "Some of the territories are supply centers. If you have captured one of these supply centers, it allows the DAO to raise and maintain armies and fleets."

          "question": "How long does a game last?",
          "answer": "A standard game of Diplomacy usually lasts for 50 rounds. For the first game, we're proposing to allocate 3 days between each round. So the game should last around 5 months, give or take."

          "question": "When does the game end?",

          "question": "Which unit types are there and how can they move?",
          "answer": "There are armies (represented by a circle) and fleets (represented by a triangle). Armies can move only on land. Fleets can move on water and coasts (land territories adjacent to water)."

          "question": "What are the different order types?",
          "answer": "- Move/attack: The unit moves to another territory and attacks (if there already is another unit occuping)\n\n- Stay/defend: Remain in the territory and possibly defend, if another DAO attacks.\n\n- Support one of their own or another DAO's army/fleet"

          "question": "What happens if a player is eliminated?",
          "answer": "Although eliminated by the rules (and thus shouldn't be able to do anything anymore), the player technically can still do moves, but the game ignores them."

          "question": "Where is the game played?",
          "answer": "The game will be deployed on Gnosis Chain (https://www.xdaichain.com/) and you can interact with it using the frontend on this website. It will use a threshold encryption scheme and the system by Shutter Network (https://shutter.network/) for encrypting moves and ensuring that the moves aren't transparent for other DAOs before they are executed."
        },
        {
          "question": "How can the players make their moves?",
          "answer": "They have to use the order planner, make a DAO proposal with the generated calldata. In order for other DAO members to see what's going on, they can share the unencrypted order privately with other DAO members. It might make sense to create a dedicated private channel for this by each DAO team."
        },

          "question": "How does the order planner work?",

        },
        {
          "question": "What is Shutter?",
          "answer": "Shutter Network is an open-source project that aims to prevent front running on Ethereum by using a threshold cryptography-based distributed key generation (DKG) protocol. Besides combating malicious MEV, it can also be used to encrypt DAO votes (https://blog.shutter.network/announcing-shutter-governance-shielded-voting-for-daos/) and in this case, in order to encrypt game moves that shouldn't be visible to other players before they're excecuted.
